This is a simple Java project that simulates mapping locations (like national parks and rivers) on a conceptual map, similar to how pins appear on services like Google Maps. It uses Java classes, records, and generics to model and organize different types of mappable entities.

Features:
	•	Models coordinates with validation (latitude and longitude checks).
	•	Supports multiple types of locations like parks and rivers.
	•	Implements a basic structure using interfaces and inheritance for mappable elements.
	•	Demonstrates good Java practices like custom constructors and type-safe collections.
